# Little League Draft Application

A comprehensive draft management system for Little League baseball divisions. Streamlines the entire draft process from player evaluation import through final team roster generation, with advanced features for handling coach's kids, siblings, and multiple draft formats.

## Features

### Multi-Division Support
- Create divisions with presets: **Majors** (ages 10-12), **AAA** (8-10), **AA** (7-10), or **Custom**
- Support for 5-10 teams per division
- Configurable age limits and max players per age group
- Independent draft states with full persistence

### Three Import Methods

**CSV Import:**
- Flexible column mapping interface
- Support for raw and pre-weighted scoring modes
- Auto-detection of common column names

**Excel Evaluation Workbooks:**

- Field-level scoring weights with real-time recalculation
- Auto-detection of coach's kids and siblings
- Direct team name and assistant coach assignment

**Dual CSV with Registration Verification:**

- Automatically matches players by name (exact and fuzzy matching)
- Exclude evaluated players not in registration list (unpaid/unregistered)
- Add registered players without evaluations as DNE (Did Not Evaluate) with 0 scores
- Ensures only eligible players are included in draft

### Pre-Draft Player Review

### Live Draft Board

The draft board provides a comprehensive interface for conducting live drafts with two switchable drawer views.

#### Drawer View Toggle
Switch between two views using the toggle bar:

- Legend bar with flag explanations and score abbreviations

**Team Rosters View** (`DraftBoardRosterView.tsx`)
- Round-by-round grid with teams as columns, rounds as rows
- Teams sorted by current round order with position numbers
- Team headers show draft position, name, and total score
- **Cell states**:
  - **Drafted** (green): Shows player name, score, and lock icon if was locked
  - **Pre-filled** (blue dashed border): Undrafted players locked to team/round (coach's kids, siblings)
  - **Current pick** (yellow ring): Active pick position with "PICKING" label
  - **Empty**: Future picks awaiting selection
- Sticky round column for horizontal scrolling
- Legend bar explaining cell colors

#### Round Interstitial Modal

- **Public View**: Read-only display for spectators (no action column, no pending confirmations, "Live View" badge)
- **Score Toggle**: Hide/show scores for presentation mode (affects both views)

### Draft Simulation
- Preview draft outcomes before committing

- **Session timeout**: Automatic 24-hour session expiration
- **Role-based authorization**: Admin-only operations for trades, resets, and member management
- **Multi-tenant isolation**: Users can only access their league's data

### Data Persistence
- **Division saved immediately**: Divisions persist as soon as "Create Division" is clicked
- Resume at any point: Close browser and return to continue where you left off
- Automatic save after each action
- Resume incomplete drafts
- Division state snapshots
- Completion timestamps for archives

### Team Builder (League Generated Teams)
For younger divisions that don't use live drafts, the Team Builder automatically creates balanced teams while honoring requests:

- **Division Mode Selection**: Choose "Live Draft" or "League Generated Teams" at division creation
- **Excel Import**: Registration Data tab with coach/teammate requests, plus evaluation tabs
- **Request Confirmation Step**:
  - Review auto-resolved requests with confidence scores
  - High-confidence matches (≥90%) auto-confirmed
  - Ambiguous matches highlighted for review
  - Edit any match with inline search
  - Two-way detection (both kids requested each other)
- **Algorithm Modes**:
  - **Requests-First (Recommended)**: Prioritizes honoring friend requests, then balances via suggested trades
  - **Balance-First**: Traditional approach prioritizing team balance over requests
- **Requests-First Algorithm**:
  - Places two-way request clusters together on same team
  - Honors one-way requests and coach preferences
  - Suggests trades to improve balance without breaking satisfied requests
- **Trade Suggestions**: After assignment, review and apply suggested trades that improve balance
- **Happiness Indicators**: Visual status showing which requests were honored (🟢 all, 🟡 some, 🔴 none, ⚪ no requests)
- **Force Even Teams**: Option to ensure all teams have equal roster sizes (±1 player)
- **Player Search**: Search by name on Results page to see request details
- **Manual Adjustments**: Swap players using the trade module
- **Export**: Happiness report CSV with request fulfillment details

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Docker and Docker Compose (for backend)

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Backend Setup

The application uses a Django REST Framework backend with PostgreSQL.

```bash
# Start backend services (API + PostgreSQL)
docker compose up -d

# Run database migrations
docker compose exec api python manage.py migrate

# Create a superuser (optional)
docker compose exec api python manage.py createsuperuser
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:3001`.

### Frontend Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

### Preview Production Build

```bash
npm run preview
```

### Stop Backend Services

```bash
docker compose down
```

## Import Formats

### CSV Format

| Column | Required | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| First Name | Yes | Player's first name |
| Last Name | Yes | Player's last name |
| Little League Age | Yes | Player's LL age (7-12) |
| FIELDING SUBTOTAL | Yes | Fielding score |
| HITTING SUBTOTAL | Yes | Hitting score |
| PITCHING SUBTOTAL | Yes | Pitching score |
| CATCH SCORE | Yes | Catching ability |
| RUNNING Score | Yes | Running speed |
| Official Adjust | No | Manual adjustment |
| Birthday | No | Player's birthday |
| All-Star | No | TRUE/FALSE |
| DNE | No | Did Not Evaluate flag |
| Coach Kid | No | TRUE/FALSE |
| Sibling | No | Sibling's full name |

### Excel Evaluation Workbook

Expected tabs: `Fielding`, `Pitching`, `Hitting`, `Fly Balls`, `Baserunning`

Each tab should include:
- `BIB#` column for player identification
- `First Name`, `Last Name` columns
- Skill-specific score columns (Form, Arm Strength, Time, etc.)

## Draft Rules

### Coach's Kids
- Must be drafted by their assigned team
- Must be drafted in their projected round (based on rank)
- System blocks other picks until fulfilled
- Round bumping available for conflicts

### Siblings
- If one sibling is drafted, the team must draft the other in that sibling's projected round
- Prevents siblings from being separated while respecting their skill-based draft position
- Automatic locking when first sibling is picked (but mandatory pick only triggers in the sibling's projected round)

### Age Limits (Optional)
- Enforce maximum players per age group
- Configurable per division type
- Prevents roster imbalances

## Workflow

```
1. CREATE DIVISION → Select preset and team count
2. IMPORT PLAYERS → Upload CSV or Excel workbook
3. REVIEW & ADJUST → Edit scores, detect relationships
4. CONFIGURE DRAFT → Set format, order, team names
5. CONDUCT DRAFT → Live picks with rule enforcement
6. COMPLETE → View results, execute trades, export
```
