/**
 * Team Builder Auto-Assignment Algorithm
 *
 * Implements a greedy assignment algorithm that:
 * 1. Places locked players first (coach kids, siblings)
 * 2. Spreads top talent evenly across teams
 * 3. Honors friend requests (two-way > one-way)
 * 4. Honors coach requests
 * 5. Clusters by school when no other signal
 * 6. Falls back to team balance
 *
 * Outputs assignments in draft-compatible format (simulated picks).
